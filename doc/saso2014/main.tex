\begin{abstract}
Combining systems that self-organize with those that self-adapt is an important problem in SASO systems.  While cellular automata have long been used as a system to study self-organization, common rule-based approaches describing the functionality of a cellular automata do not provide a capability for self-adaptation.
%
In this paper, we describe an approach to cellular automata where the rule table is replaced by state machines that have been evolved via a novel evolutionary algorithm.  Through a number of different experiments, we show how this evolutionary algorithm is able to discover state machines that solve the well-known majority bit problem in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional cellular automata.
%
We then show that probabilistic state machine are capable of self-adaptation, and that adaptive PSMs that have been evolved for the majority bit problem more readily adapt to new problems, i.e., minority bit.
%
Finally, we show that when the state machines controlling each cell in a cellular automata are provided with information regarding the global state of the automata, performance, evolvability, and scalability of the resulting solutions dramatically improve.
%
Taken together, these results strengthen the case for cellular automata as an ideal study system for self-organization, indicate CAs for further exploratory work on SASO systems, and suggest that some form of reinforcement might supersede self-adaptation as a key component of SASO systems.
